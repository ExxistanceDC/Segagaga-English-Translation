# **SEGAGAGA English Translation Patch**

Before we dive into the rest of the ReadMe, we must start with a word of thanks.

This effort simply would not have been possible without the members of the Dreamcast-Talk community that started tackling the various technical challenges in 2022. It was they who hacked the main binary, allowing it to leverage ASCII and use the Dreamcast BIOS font, built tools for extracting & re-compressing the textures, built tools for easy text reinsertion, and basically paved the way for a monkey like me to spend my days drawing, translating, and playtesting.

So, with utmost thanks:

Continuing on with the Readme...no, your eyes aren't playing tricks on you. You’re about to play Segagaga—the fun, quirky, RPG/game development simulator for Sega Dreamcast—in *English*. And you’re in for a truly unique and special experience.

Segagaga was released in March 2001 in Japan. Let’s put this into perspective: just two months earlier, on January 31, 2001, Sega announced that it was stopping production of Dreamcast consoles and would begin developing software for competitor hardware. It was a massive announcement that made waves across the gaming industry. One of the seminal hardware titans of the past 20 years was bowing out of the hardware race. For SEGA fans, it was a sad day, and the uncertainty about what the future would bring lingered for a long time afterward. (That is, until Sega started pumping out some seriously awesome games across the Xbox, PS2, and GameCube—many of which are considered classics today.)

Thus, Segagaga was released on a console that was no longer being produced. It would never make it overseas to the North American or European markets. Most Sega fans would only read about it in gaming magazines of yesteryear (like I did), regaled with stories of a unique RPG with sim-like elements that was packed with Sega references, inside jokes, and humor. 

As you’ll see, the game is everything its myth proclaims. It’s an earnest love letter to all things SEGA, with the player taking the role of Taro Sega in a quest to vanquish the evil Dogma, its fiendish sub-bosses, and finally put Sega at the top of the videogame industry after decades of underdog status. While that’s the main story thread, the game also has much to say about the challenges of game development and the videogame industry—topics that are arguably as relevant in today’s tumultuous market as they were in 2001. The game leaves all involved in game development with a timeless message:

<div align="center">Dreaming is humanity's last remaining privilege!</br>
It's not truth that paves the way—it's hope!</br>
If you forget that, you can't make games.</br></div>

## **Patching Instructions**

Grab your SGGG GDIs off the shelf! The patch is offered in two flavors: a Universal Dreamcast Patcher .DCP file and an xdelta .xdelta file.

### Option 2: xdelta

**--> Important! <--**
- Tested with <kbd>SGGG - Segagaga v1.022 (2001)(Sega)(JP)(!)</kbd> and <kbd>SGGG - Segagaga (Japan)</kbd>
- **DO NOT USE** "v2.000" or "Rev A". Due to cut content and minor changes, the patch was designed around v1.022 and will NOT work with v2.000.

## **Known Issues**

At this time, the only known issue is the spacing of the bluff (aka magic spells) cost in the Battle Mode bluff menu. You will notice that the numbers are a bit wider than the bluff name, and once they get to double-digits, they are indented farther in than the single-digit spell costs. We're still trying to hunt down a way to fix this, but it isn't game-breaking.
